*Personal project!*

Volunteer project working with a local faith group, the Catholic Community of Hopewell Valley. I prepared a survey in Google Forms and created supporting documents, including copy for a bulletin ad, the launch email, and social media posts.

I also created an Image for the social media post. Original photo by [Nancy Bauer](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/ia084)
